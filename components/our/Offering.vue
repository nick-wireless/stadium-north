          A home stadium for AFL Australia’s 20th team can become a place for all of the Territory to shine. Athletes, join the
          field to contest the ball; spectators lean back to revel in local competition bested by visiting teams from across
          Australia and the youth bound with excitement for a new vision to tomorrow and what it may behold.
